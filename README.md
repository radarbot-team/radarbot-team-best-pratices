## Contrib Guidelines
* Each user should make his contributions with his own account, for the same reason as above otherwise we won't be able to tell __who__ contributed with __what__.
* To contrib please use github issues and [pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/). Once you agree on how you will contribute either alone or with your colleagues you can create a fork from the repo, you and other committers of the same topic/document/subject have to use the same forked repository to make your changes, so you will need to agree who will be the "fork" responsible (and of course grant write permissions between yourself in your own fork).
* Once all your contributions are finished in your fork, you should send a Pull Request petition so the integrators can review it and merge it into the main repository of best practices.
* Don't forget to check if your contribution it's linked here in the [main index file](README.md) or in a parent section referenced here.
* [Here is](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) the markdown cheatsheet you can use to create your documents.
* Write in english please :), don't worry if everything is not perfect as we will continue improving this guidelines overtime as we find and implement new best practices.
* Add attributions and references if necessary to external sites, it's nice when your work is recognized by others.
* __VERY IMPORTANT__, add the images that you required to this repo in the *static* subfolder of each subsection, in this way we ensure no broken links will be ever created, avoid using external image links.
